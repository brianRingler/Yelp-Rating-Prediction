# About
***

Take a small set of reviews, from **Yelp**, and predict the rating based on the user written comment. For this project we will utilize `Naive Bayes`, `Logistic Regression` and `Decision Tree`.  

We will start by framing this as a **binary classification problem** by reviewing only **5-Star** and **1-Star** reviews. Then we will make it a **5-class** classification problem by using the ratings 1 - 5.

This dataset is only 10,000 observations from the original dataset in CSV format. The full dataset and rules for the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013/overview). The next phase will be taking the concepts practiced on this smaller dataset and use on the full dataset to achieve a score lower than 1.21250 (RMSE).
